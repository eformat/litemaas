## Quick Reference

### Essential Tools

- **axe-core**: Runtime accessibility testing in development
- **Playwright + axe**: E2E accessibility testing
- **PatternFly 6**: WCAG-compliant component library
- **Screen readers**: NVDA (Windows), VoiceOver (macOS), JAWS (Windows)

### Key Components

- `ScreenReaderAnnouncement`: ARIA live region component for dynamic announcements
- `Layout`: Main application layout with accessibility landmarks
- Accessible charts and data visualization components

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run accessibility tests
npm run test -- --testNamePattern="accessibility"

# E2E accessibility testing
npm run test:e2e -- accessibility.spec.ts

# Development mode with axe-core
npm run dev
```

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

All components and pages in LiteMaaS are designed to meet:

- ‚úÖ **Perceivable**: Content is presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- ‚úÖ **Operable**: Interface components are operable via keyboard and assistive technologies
- ‚úÖ **Understandable**: Information and UI operation are understandable
- ‚úÖ **Robust**: Content is robust enough to be interpreted by assistive technologies

## Getting Started

1. **For Developers**: Start with [Testing Guide](testing-guide.md) to understand our testing approach
2. **For Implementation**: Review [Accessibility Patterns](patterns.md) for component guidelines
3. **For Dynamic Content**: See [ARIA Live Regions](aria-live-regions.md) for announcement patterns
4. **For Frontend Testing**: Use [Frontend Testing](frontend-testing.md) for component-specific procedures
