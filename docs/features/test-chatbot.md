4. **System Prompt**: Define assistant behavior (optional)

#### 3. Start Testing
1. **Type your message** in the input field at the bottom
2. **Click Send** or press Enter to submit
3. **View response** in the message history area
4. **Check analytics** in the response info panel on the right

### Advanced Usage

#### Using Quick Test Templates
1. **Click any template button** (Code Generation, Translation, etc.)
2. The **prompt text** will populate the input field
3. **Customize if needed** before sending
4. **Save custom variations** using the "Save Prompt" button

#### Saving Custom Prompts
1. **Type or modify** a prompt you want to save
2. **Click "Save Prompt"** button
3. **Enter a name** and optional description
4. **Click "Save"** to add to your prompt library
5. **Access later** from "My Prompts" dropdown

#### Exporting Conversations
1. **Click "Export"** button after testing
2. **Choose format**: JSON (technical) or Markdown (readable)
3. **Click "Download"** to save the file
4. **File includes**:
   - Complete message history
   - Configuration settings used
   - Performance metrics
   - Timestamps and metadata

#### Analyzing Responses
- **Response Time**: Monitor API latency for performance planning
- **Token Usage**: Track consumption for cost management
- **Cost Estimation**: Real-time pricing based on model rates
- **Raw Response**: Access complete API response for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Please select an API key"
- **Cause**: No API key selected
- **Solution**: Choose an API key from the dropdown
- **Prevention**: Ensure you have created at least one API key

#### "Please select a model"
- **Cause**: No model selected or API key has no model access
- **Solution**: 
  - Select a model from the dropdown
  - Verify your API key has model permissions
  - Check your model subscriptions are active

#### "Authentication failed"
- **Cause**: Invalid or expired API key
- **Solution**:
  - Verify the API key is active and not revoked
  - Check API key hasn't expired
  - Try refreshing the API key using the "Show Key" feature

#### "Rate limit exceeded"
- **Cause**: Too many requests in a short time
- **Solution**: Wait before sending more messages
- **Prevention**: Monitor request frequency, especially with high-traffic testing

#### "Request timed out"
- **Cause**: Network issues or server overload
- **Solution**:
  - Check your internet connection
  - Try again in a few moments
  - Try a different model if available

#### "Server error"
- **Cause**: Issue with the LiteLLM service
- **Solution**:
  - Wait and try again
  - Check if other models work
  - Contact support if problem persists

### Model-Specific Issues

#### Model Not Available
- **Verify subscription**: Ensure you have an active subscription to the model
- **Check API key permissions**: Confirm the API key has access to the model
- **Model status**: Some models may be temporarily unavailable

#### Unexpected Responses
- **Check system prompt**: Ensure system prompt doesn't conflict with your request
- **Adjust temperature**: Lower temperature for more consistent results
- **Model limitations**: Different models have different capabilities and response styles

## Best Practices

### Testing Strategy
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic prompts to verify connectivity
2. **Test Systematically**: Use built-in templates to test different capabilities
3. **Document Results**: Export conversations for later analysis
4. **Compare Models**: Test the same prompt with different models
5. **Iterate Settings**: Experiment with temperature and token limits

### Cost Management
1. **Monitor Usage**: Watch token consumption in the response info panel
2. **Set Token Limits**: Use max tokens setting to control costs
3. **Choose Models Wisely**: Consider cost per token when selecting models
4. **Export Data**: Save results to avoid re-running expensive tests

### Security Considerations
1. **Protect API Keys**: Don't share screenshots showing full API keys
2. **Sensitive Data**: Avoid testing with confidential information
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect rate limits to maintain service quality
4. **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys for security

## Integration Examples

### Using Test Results in Applications
1. **Copy Settings**: Use successful temperature and token settings in your apps
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Refine prompts based on test results
3. **Model Selection**: Choose optimal models based on performance and cost
4. **Error Handling**: Plan error handling based on observed failure modes

### Development Workflow
1. **Prototype Prompts**: Test and refine prompts before coding
2. **Validate Models**: Ensure models meet requirements before integration
3. **Performance Planning**: Use response time data for architecture decisions
4. **Cost Estimation**: Use token usage data for budget planning
